# cs39aa_final_project
final project for CS39aa: NLP w/ Deep Learning

 Example Text Dataset: Intro
• explore data, e.g. what does the 
vocabulary look like, how are the 
targets distributed, etc.
2. Establish baseline model
• could be a basic model (e.g.
random forest) or simple NN with 
basic one-hot encoded features, 
etc.
3. Train/Tune more complex model(s)
• more preprocessing/feature￾engineering
• train a sophisticated NN model, or 
fine-tune a pre-trained model 
(e.g. RoBERTa) 
4. Conclusion
• describe differences in models 
(performance, training, etc.)
• next steps (what to do next if you 
continuing on the project)

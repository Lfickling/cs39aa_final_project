I'm using the dataset books.csv which was created by kaggle user Soumik by scraping data from the goodreads API (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks?select=books.csv). Goodreads is a popular website that lists books and allows users to rate and review them. The dataset contains the following features: title, authors, average rating, isbn, language, page numbers, number of ratings, and number of reviews. \n","\n","I'm going to develop a model based on this dataset that will take a hypothetical book title as an input, like 'the october rhinocerous' and output a prediction of its rating from 0.00 to 5.00 stars. this could be interpreted as either classification (with each integer amount of stars being a seperate catagory) or regression. As it is more closely aligned with the dataset, i'm going to interpret it as regression: predicting the relationship between the continuous dependent variable rating and the independent variable title.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Exploratory Data Analysis\n","\n","_You will now load the dataset and carry out some exploratory data analysis steps to better understand what text data looks like.
